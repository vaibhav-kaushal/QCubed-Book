# QCubed

QCubed is a PHP development framework. If you have heard of frameworks like Wordpress, Joomla and Drupal and think QCubed is one of them, then you are wrong. QCubed is not a CMS framework. It does _not_ manage content for you. QCubed is a development framework.

When you install QCubed, you do not get a ready-made blog or e-commerce site. Instead you get tools to build them. You can build practically anything you can think of with QCubed \(you are going to need some database skills though\).

This book covers the basics of QCubed, the possibilities. It teaches you things that you will help you build what you want. Sure, you are going to go through some examples and sample code and an application. But that is not where possibilities end. It's just like having a carpenter's toolbox with you. You do not get a ready-made chair in it. You get saws, drillers, nuts, bolts, nails, hammers. You've got to use them and build what you need.

So if you are not a developer _and do not plan to become one_, this book is not for you.
