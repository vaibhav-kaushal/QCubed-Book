# Installing QCubed

Installation is quite easy. There are difficult ways and there are easy ways. The difficult ways are there when the easy ways fail - just like in other parts of a normal human's life. Naturally, the difficult methods are for those who are more seasoned developers. 

If you are not an experienced one, panic not. With time you will adapt to everything and as your brain learns how things work here, the difficult parts will be easy enough for you to pursue. The detailed methods of installation reveal certain things about the structure of this framework. I recommend you try installing QCubed manually later on with leisure.
