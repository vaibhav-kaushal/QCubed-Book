# Hi!

In this chapter I will introduce to you QCubed, the true RAD framework built atop PHP. If you already know what QCubed is, you can skip it. But if you do not know what it is, chances are, you will be mind-blown by what you can do with QCubed by the time you have finished this chapter.

But before we begin, I wanted to say a hi to you. 

## Hope you're feeling great!

Within the pages of this book, while you read, you will find my voice running through your head and it would be a little impolite if I started talking to you without first saying _Hi!_

I hope that you are having a good time and that this book helps you get more of the good times.

If you would like help with QCubed, create an issue in QCubed's official repo by going to [**https://github.com/qcubed/qcubed/issues/new**](https://github.com/qcubed/qcubed/issues/new). If you just want to reach out to me \(and probably buy me coffee ;\) or know more about me, my contacts are available at: [**vaibhavkaushal.com**](http://vaibhavkaushal.com/). 

## Who is this book for?

This book is for the guy or girl who wants to make something. Build a new product for fun, or for work. Someone who knows the basics of web and development. I am not going to teach how to install Apache web server, or MySQL or PostgreSQL databases or PHP or any of the millions of extensions. I am not going to teach the basic parts. If you are to begin, here are the things you must be knowing before you start:

1. How to install the servers - Apache \(web server\), MySQL or PostgreSQL \(database server\).

2. How to install PHP and PHP's extensions.

3. How to make sure the tools \(Apache, PHP, MySQL\) work together and well.

4. How to use composer.


In case you do not know about them, please learn them.

Also, I am just going to presume the developer to be a male. Throughout the book, you will see me referring to the developer \(you\) as a male. This is not because I am sexist but because I am a male and when I started writing this book, I wrote it the way I would have wanted a book like this to be.

Since I wrote most of the documentation \(except the examples\), I had to learn everything by going through the source code. If you really want to know how QCubed works, read the framework source code; there is no better way. But till the time you can, this book is here to help - it's what I wrote it for.

## Can I contribute?

I would love to have contributions, suggestions and recommendations. If you have already done something with QCubed - articles, documentation, videos, made something good with the framework, let me know. I would include them in the book. Also, if you have suggestions, improvements or recommendations to make, just open an issue [here](https://github.com/vaibhav-kaushal/QCubed-Book/issues) and I shall get back to you on GitHub.
