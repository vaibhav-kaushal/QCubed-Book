# Introduction to QCubed

QCubed is a PHP development framework. No, not a CMS framework like Wordpress or Drupal, but a development framework. When you install QCubed, you will not get a ready-made blog. You will get a platform on which you can build whatever other things that you want to. So, if you want to build a blog, you will have to program it yourself. QCubed will help you in building the blog though.

QCubed gives you tools to build, not the end-product. The end product has to be written by you!

QCubed \(the **_framework_**\) is a [MVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)-based framework. The best way to understand is with examples and we have a good [examples website](http://qcu.be/examples) for that. QCubed ensures that your Model, Views and Controllers are separate. You can restructure things the way you want; but just like any other framework, QCubed too will demand you to structure your app in a certain way. 

So you can either learn more about the features, or just go ahead with Installation.
